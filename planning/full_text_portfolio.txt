Background

Grey is an artist and designer raised in the SF Bay Area. They have been learning to speak Mandarin Chinese (reading and writing traditional Chinese characters) since they were five years old, and considers it their first passion. Though the subject of study often changes, their love of learning has remained constant.

Learning & Skills

Grey studied history at Smith College c/o 2019, focusing on power, colonialism & social change, though officially concentrating in East Asian history. There they developed valuable tools in critical thinking, textual & historical analysis, and communication. After undergrad, they decided to pursue visual arts. They currently study studio art and web design at Diablo Valley College in the Bay.
